The Spree Deployment Service is a free tool that allows you to configure
and deploy the Spree Software Stack on any dedicated cloud, virtual
private or physical server.

The service can be configured to create single and multi-server
configurations on a wide range of Linux based operating systems, and
supports deploying demo Spree applications or generating Capistrano
recipes for deploying your own application.

## Understanding server roles

The Deployment Service supports a wide range of configuration topologies
by allowing you to choose individual roles for each server within your
deployment.

Each role installs and configures different software packages on the
target server, and a server can have one or more roles applied.

Available roles currently include:

-   **Application Server** - Installs and configures Nginx, Ruby, and
    more. Every deployment requires at least one Application Server, but
    can have as many as required.

-   **Database Server** - Installs and configures MySQL, Ruby. Only one
    Database Server can be configured for a deployment.

-   **Utility Server** - Installs and configures Ruby. A deployment can
    have as many Utility Servers as needed, but a Utility Server role
    cannot be shared with any other role. Utility Servers generally run
    Delayed Job workers, Solr indexes, Redis or Memcache services but
    these applications must be configured manually and will not be
    installed by the Deployment Service.

-   **Load Balancer** - Can only be applied to an Application Server and
    configures Nginx to load balance Rails requests to all applications
    servers unicorn back ends. The Load Balancer will handle all
    requests for static assets (stylesheets, JavaScript files, images,
    etc).

***
Every server will get some basic configuration, such as Rails
Environment environment variable, placeholder directories for your Spree
application, automatically generated database.yml and Procfile files,
and more.
***

## Typical server role combinations

For a **Single Server** deployment, you would select **Application** and
**Database** as the two roles for your single server.

For **Multi Server** deployments, you would generally select the
following:

-   At least one dedicated **Application Server**.

-   One dedicated **Database Server**.

-   One application server can be designated as the **Load Balancer** if
    you have more that one application server (and you are not using a
    third party load balancing service).

-   Any number of **Utility Servers** as required by your application.

## Using the deployment service

The deployment service can be accessed by via the
[Stores](http://spreecommerce.com/stores/) tab under [My
Account](http://spreecommerce.com/account).

Each Store can have one or more "deployments" configured (for
production, staging or qa environments), and each deployment can have
one or more servers.

To create a deployment:

**1.** Add a new Store or click on an existing store, and choose the
**"Add Deployment Service"** link.

Each **deployment** has a number of global parameters which affects all
servers configured within that environment including:

-   **Operating System** - The Deployment Service currently supports
    Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

-   **Rails Environment** - Sets the server wide rails environment,
    default 'production'.

-   **Ruby Version** - Select the preferred Ruby version you would like
    installed.

-   **Spree Version** - If you choose to install a sample application
    (see below), the Spree version selected here will be the one used by
    the sample app. If you choose to deploy your own custom
    application,\
    the Spree Version affects the Capistrano Recipe that gets generated.

-   **What would you like deployed** - Choose "A Sample Application" if
    you do not have a Spree application ready to deploy, or "My own
    custom Spree application" if you do.

-   **Git URL for your application** - Only available when deploying
    your own application and this value is only used to complete your
    generated Capistrano Recipe.

**2.** Once you've configured the global environments details, click
"Add" to save the configuration.

Now you need to provide details on each **server** that's included in
the environment:

-   **Fully Qualified Domain Name** - This should be something like
    `app1.test.com` or `db1.test.com`, it does not
    need to be registered or resolvable it is purely used for naming
    purposes.

-   **IP Address** - It's important to supply the correct IP address
    as it's referenced in several locations within the configuration and
    supplying an invalid value will result in problems with the
    configuration. You can use internal / private addresses for your
    servers as the only requirement is that all servers can communicate
    with each other using the addresses supplied.

-   **Unicorn Workers** - This value is only required for servers with
    the **Application Server** role, and controls how many worker
    processes the unicorn master process will fork on startup. Setting
    this value correctly is important, see the [Deployment Options Guide](deployment_options) for details on memory
    requirements / workers.

-   **Roles** - Select the required roles for the server, see the
    **Understanding Server Roles** section above for more details.

**3.** When you've added the details for all the servers in your
deployment, you should then change the **Configuration Status** from
"New" to "Complete".

This will upload your server configurations to our deployment server,
which may take a few moments. Refresh the page occasionally until you
see each servers **Status** change from "Waiting for update from
configuration server." to "Ready to Deploy".

**4.** Now each server will have a **Initialize Configuration** command
that must be copied and executed on the relevant server.

This needs to be done as root user, and can take several minutes to
complete.

***
It's important to be aware that while all the **Initialize
Configurations** commands appear similar they are server specific so be
sure to run the correct command on each server.
***

!!!
The **Initialize Configuration** command should only be run on
servers that are intended to be dedicated Spree servers, it reconfigures
large parts of the server to fulfill it's assigned roles and many affect
any other applications, configuration or data already present on a
server.
!!!

**5.** When the initialize configuration command completes the server
will report it's result and you should see each server's Status
eventually update to **"Reported as 'changed'"**.

***
If an error occurs during the build the status might not update or
it may update as **"Reported as 'failed'"**, in either event you should
attempt to run the **Update Configuration** command listed.
***

**6.** Finally when all servers have reported as either **'changed'** or
**'unchanged'** the final step is to run the **Update configuration**
command to set your site specific database passwords.

The command is generally something like:

```bash
$ FACTER_db_pass=YOUR_DB_PASSWORD puppet agent â€”test
```

It's important to substitute YOUR_DB_PASSWORD with the actual password
you require.

**7.** Congratulations you now have a fully configured environment ready
for use.

If you choose to deploy a "Sample Application" then you should be able
to browser to your Application Servers IP address to view the store
running.

If you are deploying your own application, please refer to the [Deploying your application on Ubuntu](ubuntu), [Deploying your application on Heroku](heroku), or [Deploying your application on Ninefold](ninefold) Guides for more.

## Application Process

The Spree Deployment Service uses Foreman & Upstart to define and manage all the processes required by your application.

### Using Foreman

All application processes are managed using
[Foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) and a default Procfile is
generated for you in `/data/spree/shared/config/Procfile`

By default this includes a single Unicorn master process, the unicorn
workers are configured via the Deployment Server UI.

Default Procfile contents:

```bash
$ web: bundle exec unicorn_rails -c /data/app_name/shared/config/unicorn.rb -p $PORT -E ENV
```

The provided Capistrano deployment script symlinks the Procfile into
location after each deploy.

Capistrano Procfile Snippet:

```ruby
namespace :deploy do
  desc "Symlink shared configs and folders on each release."
  task :symlink_shared do
    run "ln -nfs #/config/database.yml #/config/database.yml"
    run "ln -nfs #{shared_path}/config/Procfile #{release_path}/Procfile"
  end
end

after 'deploy:update_code', 'deploy:symlink_shared'
```

***
It's important to remember to not edit the Procfile above
directly, any changes to this file will be reset automatically by our
configuration management system. See the "Customizing Processes" section
below for more details on how to correctly change this file.
***

### Upstart

After each deployment of your application the Procfile is exported to
Upstart compatible configuration files which the operating system uses
to manage your application's processes.

Upstart is responsible for starting, stopping and restarting the
processes and will detect if a process has stopped for some reason and
automatically restart it. Upstart does not monitor for memory size
growth, and will not restart leaky processes automatically.

Using Upstart you control the processes of application in a number of
ways:

#### All Processes

You can use following commands to start, stop or restart all the
processes in your application at once:

```bash
$ sudo stop spree
$ sudo start spree
$ sudo restart spree
```

#### Processes by type

To control all processes of a specific type you can use:

```bash
$ sudo start spree-web
$ sudo stop spree-worker
$ sudo restart spree-solr
```

#### Individual Processes

You can control individual processes by prepending the process number at
the end:

```bash
$ sudo start spree-web-1
$ sudo stop spree-worker-3
$ sudo restart spree-solr-2
```

***
The process number is the concurrency number specified in the foreman export, and not the PID.
***

### Customizing Processes

To add additional processes such as Delayed Job workers to your
application, complete the following steps:

* Copy the contents of the default Procfile and save it in the root our application.
* Make any additions or changes you require.
* Remove the Procfile symlink link line from your config/deploy.rb file.
* Commit your changes and deploy the application.
* When your application is deployed the new processes will be automatically started.

Sample Procfile containing Delayed Job workers:

```bash
$ web: bundle exec unicorn_rails -c /data/app_name/shared/config/unicorn.rb -p $PORT -E production
$ worker: bundle exec rake jobs:work
```

### Changing process concurrency

By default the provided Capistrano script will export a single process
for each entry in Procfile, for some process types you want to increase
the number of processes started, for example Delayed Job workers. You
can customize the number of process exported for each process type by
editing the foreman:export task in the Capistrano script.

Custom Capistrano `deploy.rb` - creating 3 worker processes:

```ruby
namespace :foreman do
  desc "Export the Procfile to Ubuntu's upstart scripts"
  task :export, :roles => :app do
    run "cd #{current_path} && bundle exec foreman export upstart /etc/init -a #{application} -c worker=3 -u spree"
  end
  â€¦
end
```

The `-c` (or `--concurrency`) switch accepts the process type and an integer
for the number of processes to start up. You specify mulitple types by
comma separating as follows: `processname=2,processname=4`

!!!
It's important to not export more than one :web process when
using the default unicorn configuration, as this refers to the master
process and not the workers, the worker count can be configured via the
Deployment's Service UI.
!!!

## Configuration & Customization

### Configuration Management

All servers configured with the Spree Deployment Service are configured
as clients to our public Puppet server. Puppet is a ruby based
configuration management system (similar to Chef), and using it allows
us to centrally control and update all configurations to ensure your
server is always running the best possible configuration.

Using Puppet also restricts how you can edit or change certain key
configuration files, we provide several extension points when you can
make your changes to files while still receiving the benefits of Puppet
for other files.

***
Puppet is not configured (or intended) to be run as a client
daemon on your server, you should only run the update commands on an as
needed basis.
***

### Server Configurations

All servers are currently configured with the following basic elements:

-   Ruby - compiled from source using ruby-build, installed system wide
-   Puppet client 2.7.x
-   Git
-   Foreman - process management

Depending on the role assigned to a server it may get some or all of the
following:

**Application Servers:**

-   Unicorn - rack application server
-   Nginx - web server / unicorn front end

**Database Server:**

-   MySQL - database server

### File Locations

Every server contains a single directory that houses the application and
all serves as a location to configure several key aspects of the servers
software stack:

-   `/data/` - top level directory that contains all application
    specific data.

-   `/data/spree/` - houses the application itself, serves as the
    deploy destination in Capistrano scripts.

-   `/data/spree/current/` - the current live / production version of
    the application code (symlink to the relevant releases
    subdirectory).

-   `/data/spree/releases/` - contains current and last 5 deployed
    releases of the application's code.

-   `/data/spree/shared/` - directories and files that are common
    among all deployed versions of an application (like assets,
    configuration files, etc).

-   `/data/spree/shared/config/` - contains several application
    specific configuration files including:
    -   `database.yml` - Automatically generated configuration file
        for Rails / ActiveRecord, contains all the details required to
        connect the associated applications database. This file is
        sym-linked into place as part of the Capistrano deploy process.
    -   `Procfile` - Automatically generated process configuration
        files, for more see the Application Processes article. This file
        is sym-linked into place as part of the Capistrano deploy
        process.
    -   `unicorn.rb` - Automatically generated unicorn configuration
        file, reference by the Procfile above when starting the
        application server processes.

-   `/etc/ssl` - You can upload your SSL certificate files into this
    directory and the will be automatically used by Puppet in your
    application Nginx configuration file. See the [Requesting and
    Configuring SSL Guide](requesting_and_configuring_ssl) for more details.
